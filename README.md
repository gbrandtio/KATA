## What is KATA ?

Simply, KATA involves deliberate, repetitive practice in order to reach mastery. For Software Engineering and Business, KATA can be defined with the same nuances taken from martial arts, incorporating repetitive exercises and problem solving etc until a best practice becomes second nature.

## Purpose of this repository
The purpose of this repository is to exercise mainly on best practices, clean code, system architecture and design.

## Build
All the projects are built inside their respective ```dist``` folder. 
- ```npm run build```: Will compile all the ts files.
- ```npm run test```: Will run all the tests.

## Contributing
This repository is strictly for KATA practicing and enhancing the ability to write clean code, follow design patterns and producing top quality, maintainable and extendible code. If you share a passion for clean code and best practices feel free to raise a PR with your own KATA or enhancing one of the existing KATAs.
